# Exonom

Blockchain smart decentralized application powered by Binance Smart Chain technology system

# Description

The main purpose to build a Exonom project is to make all the decentralized applications running on top of blockchain technology easier to manage and visa versa. Exonom will have it's own decentralized application platform linked with a complete set of developer tools, SDKs and APIs which are used to create decentralized applications. By integrating S-DAP(Smart Decentralized Application Platform), DAPPs services between blockchain DAPPs and off-chain services can be achieved. In addition,Exonom has an extra advantage in this case. Because it is based on Binance Chain, the transaction complexities caused by the interactions between different chains can be avoided because all transactions do happen on one chain only; Exonom. Similarly, off-chain service providers (which could be big companies too) will have their own consensus nodes which are operated by themselves to verify the integrity of their service quality. otherwise, they would not be able to provide service for any business cases. With this unique design approach, Exonom can dramatically lower the threshold bar for any businesses to climb onto blockchain technology by allowing them to use wallets for payment settlement and transfer instead of writing complicated smart contracts using Solidity programming language.

Decentralized applications (DApps) are one of the most exciting developments in blockchain technology. DApps are applications that run on a decentralized network, not a centralized server. They're powered by smart contracts, which are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the performance of a contract.

The benefits of DApps include:

-Immutability: No single user has enough power to change the records kept by the DApp

-Trustless system: Users don't need to trust anyone else in order to use the DApp, because there's no central authority storing their information and verifying transactions

-Highly resistant to censorship: It's difficult for authorities to shut a DApp down because there's no central server they can target

-No single point of failure: The data is stored on thousands of different computers rather than on a central server

# Mission

A next-generation Blockchain platform that uses patent pending technology to execute transactions via a state of the art secure, scalable, and green protocol. Exonom is geared towards enterprise applications, boasting a transaction rate that matches Visa in scale.

# Exonom Voice

Smart And The Best.

# Value Proposition

Decentralized application development platform: Exonom aims to pioneer the concept of decentralized applications by providing an easy to use yet powerful decentralized application platform. Exonom will enable the creation of dApps on blockchain smart chain which works on mobile devices as well as desktops and web browsers. Using Exonom will never require downloading new applications or data onto users' devices.
